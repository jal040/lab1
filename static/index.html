	<p> Hello! I am a third year undergraduate student at University of California, San Diego. I am studying to achieve my bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science, specifically in Human Computer Interaction, and a minor in Computer Science. I visited Seattle this summer and attended a hands-on design workshop. The speakers and group projects opened my eyes to a new world of design. I hope to learn everything I can from Professor Klemmer and my classmates. </p>
