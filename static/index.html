	<p> Jamie is a third year undergraduate student at University of California, San Diego. She is studying to achieve a bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science, specifically in Human Computer Interaction, and a minor in Computer Science. She visited Seattle this summer and attended a hands-on design workshop. The speakers and group projects opened her eyes to a new world of design. She hopes to learn everything she can from Professor Klemmer and her classmates. </p>
